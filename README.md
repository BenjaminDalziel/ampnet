Digital twins of human mobility in cities using Adaptive Massively Parallel NETworks

## For our small-scale deployment, we are focusing on building a Digital Twin of the city of Newport, Oregon, est. pop. 10,489. 

### Neural networks are trained to represent patterns of human mobility within the city.

### Geospatial features represented in the Digital Twin:

_Residential and non-residential buildings extracted from the FEMA USA Structures dataset._

_Census Block Group geometry provided by the U.S. Census Bureau._

_Hourly Arrival Counts (human mobility data) provided by SafeGraph (with identity protections)._

### We can therefore examine the name, building classification, hourly visits, Census Block Group, and aggregated daily visits at each location.

### Our individual neural nets will be trained in parallel and collectively validated against these real-world patterns.

### With additional resources, we aim to scale the use of these Digital Twins to numerous cities in Oregon with varying characteristics.
